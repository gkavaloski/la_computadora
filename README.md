An English/Spanish teaching aid for nerds

I'm learning Spanish, and wanted to create a programming aid to assist me.
It's operation is simple: it displays an English phrase, and you must translate it into Spanish. 

The phrases used are derived from sentences I've had issues with. The focus isn't on grammar: it's on fluency.

Feel free to use this, but part of the learning journey has been designing it. Take that as you will...

I suggest rewriting the phrases to match your needs.
